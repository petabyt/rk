At some point I was trying to get a PDF table parser going so I could translate them into a C struct.  
This had mixed results especially since the PDF table formats were weird. I also used chatgpt and claude, and that ended up being
just as painful since I had to manually fix its mistakes in not noticing register gaps.

So I give you these files in hope that you don't have to go through the pain I went through.
