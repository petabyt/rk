# RK3588 bare metal bringup
Everything needed to bring up common hardware.

You will need the official rockchip-developed ddr image: https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin/blob/master/bin/rk35/rk3588_ddr_lp4_2112MHz_lp5_2400MHz_v1.18.bin

## MMU

## Secure GRF init
A small sequence (100LoC) is needed to mark needed memory regions as secure. This is done primarily through the
main SGRF (Secure General Register File). There are actually a few SGRFs, and they are all undocumented.
This is necessary to use the VOP and setup a framebuffer.

## PMU
A few power domains need to be brought up in order to make some hardware accessible.
These onboard devices are completely powered off on reset. If you try to read/write to their mmio addresses, you will get a translation error.

- PD_PHP
- PD_PCIE
- PD_GMAC
- PD_SECURE
- PD_VOP
- PD_VO0
- PD_VO1

Powering on a power domain is fairly well documented in the TRM.

Other hardware such as GIC, UART, and other essentials belong to the ALIVE power domain.
It is powered up on with a reset, and cannot be powered off.
