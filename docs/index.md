# Rockchip bare metal reference
This is a work-in-progress resource for bare-metal bringup for Rockchip devices.

I learned all this and made this resource during my time working for FUTO doing bringup for our unreleased (top secret) [FUBS project](https://gitlab.futo.org/eron/public/-/wikis/FUBS).

If you are interested in Rockchip SoCs or ARM in general, consider [applying for a job or sending us your resume](https://futo.org/jobs/)!
