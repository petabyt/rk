# Rockchip bare metal reference
This is a resource for bare-metal bringup on RK3399 and RK3588-based devices.

I learned all this and make all this documentation during my time working for FUTO doing bringup for our unreleased FUBS project.

For RK3399 bringup, I initially wrote everything in C before porting it to our own language, as I was still learning and figuring things out.
For RK3588 bringup, our system was robust enough to to bringup without a separate C implementation.
