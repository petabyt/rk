# Rockchip bare metal reference
This is a resource for bare-metal bringup for Rockchip devices.

I learned all this and made this resource during my time working for FUTO doing bringup for our unreleased (top secret) [FUBS project](https://gitlab.futo.org/eron/public/-/wikis/FUBS).

If you are interested in Rockchip SoCs or ARM in general, consider [applying for a job or sending us your resume](https://futo.org/jobs/)!

For RK3399 bringup, I initially wrote everything in C before porting it to our own language, the source code can be found here: https://github.com/petabyt/rk  
For RK3588 bringup, FUBS had improved enough to do bringup without a separate C implementation.
